// Create web server
// Create a web server that listens to the port 3000. It should respond to the following URLs:
// /comments - returns a list of comments from the file comments.json
// /comment - adds a comment to the comments.json file
// /count - returns the number of comments in the comments.json file
// The server should read and write to the comments.json file using the fs module. If the comments.json file does not exist, it should be created with an empty array.
